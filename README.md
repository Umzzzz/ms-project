Major Project for University 

A professional website for a digital agency called Mars Spiders, based in Central London to launch in Russia. The main reason for launching in Russia is to expand and attract clients in the international market. The site is fully responsive and has met the clientâ€™s aims and objectives. 
The methodology used to help with the progression of the project was Agile which included planning, developing, testing and launching phases. 
Multiple tests were conducted to make sure the project was completed to a high standard which followed guidelines of the web sector industry.

Case / work page will be developed sometime in the future as the client did not provide the Russian translate. 
During this project the original designs have been changed as they were weak, so Umair had complete control of the design elements of the whole site. 
Once all the improvements have been made, at a later stage the website will be moving to Mars Spiders Russia domain.
